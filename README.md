Features
MVVM with Clean Architecture

Clear separation between Presentation, Domain, and Data layers.

ViewModels contain all UI-related logic and communicate with use cases.

Repositories abstract the data layer, making the code modular and testable.

Highly maintainable and easy to extend for large applications.

SwiftUI

Fully declarative user interface.

Real-time view updates using data-driven rendering.

Supports adaptive layouts, smooth animations, and modern UI components.

Clean integration with ViewModels using state management patterns.

Modern Concurrency (async/await)

Structured concurrency for clean and predictable asynchronous logic.

Simplified network calls, background tasks, and data processing.

Reduced complexity compared to completion handlers and older async patterns.

Better readability and reliability.

CI/CD Pipeline

Automated builds, tests, and releases.

GitHub Actions and Fastlane integration for continuous delivery.

Automatic TestFlight deployment or App Store release.

Code signing handled securely using App Store Connect API keys.

Ensures consistent, fast, and stable delivery across teams.
